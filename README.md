A Lua front-end for LLVM, written in Haskell. This compiler is meant to translate Lua source code into native code (via LLVM IR) that simply calls through to the Lua C API. This project is primarily a learning exercise from start to finish, so don't expect to use this on your production code anytime soon.

This project is public domain, and can be incorporated for free and without any attribution for any use.
